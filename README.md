Project Report: Predicting Cancer Drug Resistance using Machine Learning
Project Title: Prediction of Cancer Drug Resistance Using Supervised Learning Techniques

1. Introduction
Cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly diseases globally, and the treatment strategies are often limited by the development of drug resistance. Drug resistance occurs when cancer cells no longer respond to the medications that previously slowed or stopped their growth. The aim of this project is to predict the likelihood of drug resistance in cancer cells using various features such as gene expression, drug information, and cell line data. The ultimate goal is to identify patterns in the data that could help in predicting which drugs will be effective for which cancer types.

2. Problem Statement
The problem at hand is the prediction of drug resistance in cancer cells, which is a critical challenge in oncology. The primary focus is to predict the sensitivity of cancer cells to different drugs, based on several features including gene expression, cancer type, and drug-related properties. The target variable used for this prediction is LN_IC50, which represents the log-concentration of a drug needed to inhibit 50% of cancer cell growth. A lower LN_IC50 value indicates higher drug sensitivity, while a higher value indicates resistance.

3. Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) repository. It includes features such as:

Gene expression levels: Expression of various genes in the cancer cells.

Cell line data: Information on different cancer cell lines used in the experiments.

Drug information: Data related to the drugs tested on the cancer cells.

Other features: Additional factors like pathways, drug class, and cancer type.

The target variable is LN_IC50, which measures the drug sensitivity.

4. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step before applying machine learning algorithms. The dataset undergoes several stages of preprocessing:

Handling missing values: Rows with missing target values (LN_IC50) are removed, and rows with other missing values are optionally dropped.

Encoding categorical variables: Categorical features such as CELL_LINE_NAME, DRUG_NAME, PATHWAY_NAME, and others are encoded using label encoding, transforming them into numerical values.

Feature scaling: Features that are continuous and numerical are scaled to ensure that no feature dominates due to its scale. Standardization (z-score) is applied to the numerical features such as MIN_CONC, MAX_CONC, etc.

5. Modeling
In this project, supervised learning techniques are employed to predict drug resistance. The following steps were taken:

Train-test split: The data is divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

Model selection: A Random Forest Regressor is chosen for this task. This model is suitable for tabular data and helps capture non-linear relationships between features. It also provides insights into feature importance.

Model training: The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set.

6. Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using two metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.

R² Score: This metric indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An R² score closer to 1 indicates that the model does a good job of explaining the variance in the data.

For this project, the results obtained were:

MSE: 0.0200

R² Score: 0.9978

These results indicate a very good model performance, as the R² score is very close to 1, and the MSE is quite low, implying that the model is able to make accurate predictions about drug resistance.

7. Stratified Performance Analysis
To gain deeper insights into the model's performance, the analysis was stratified by cancer type (TCGA_DESC), drug class (DRUG_NAME), and pathway (PATHWAY_NAME). This was done to examine how the model performs across different groups and identify if there are certain drug types or cancer types where the model performs exceptionally well or poorly.

The following steps were taken for this analysis:

MSE and R² for each category: These metrics were calculated for each unique value in the stratification column (e.g., for each cancer type or drug class).

Visualization: The results were visualized using bar plots to highlight the top categories in terms of MSE and R².

8. Feature Importance
The Random Forest model provides insights into the importance of each feature in predicting drug resistance. Feature importance is calculated based on how much each feature contributes to reducing the error in predictions. The most important features were identified and visualized to gain a better understanding of which factors influence drug sensitivity and resistance the most.

9. Results
The model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting cancer drug resistance. With an R² score of 0.9978, the model is able to explain a very large proportion of the variance in drug sensitivity. The stratified performance analysis and feature importance analysis provide additional insights into the specific categories and features that are most influential in predicting drug resistance.

10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest regression, to predict cancer drug resistance. The model shows promising results, with high accuracy and low error. The findings of this project could potentially assist in identifying effective cancer treatments for different types of cancer, improving the clinical decision-making process, and personalizing cancer therapies.

11. Future Work
There are several areas for future work:

Model Improvement: Experimenting with other models like Gradient Boosting Machines or Neural Networks could further improve the accuracy.

Incorporating more features: Including more detailed genetic data or additional drug-related features might enhance the model.

Real-World Application: Applying this model in a real-world clinical setting could help physicians make better decisions regarding cancer treatment.

This project is a step forward in the fight against cancer, leveraging the power of machine learning to predict drug resistance and improve treatment outcomes.e
